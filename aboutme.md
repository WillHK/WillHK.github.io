I'm a full stack web developer with a focus on curating, analyzing and generating actionable business decisions from data. 

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
